    "#Overview of Assignment:\n",
    "The purpose of this Simulation is to simulate a population of animals and who can do basic interaction with eachother and others and to be able to use this simulation to run tests to find the best way to maximise how long they will last with diffirent combinations of numbers of animals and food.\n",
    "\n",
    "My take on the PaSciRo simulation slightly varied from some suggestions provided in the assignment description. I used three animals but I didn't have have a paper, scissors, rock way of describing which animal would eat which, I decided to structure it around real life food chains, food eaten by omnivore and herbivore and those two types of animals eaten by the Carnivore. \n",
    "\n",
    "To try and balance these animals, I had created unique movement patterns with the thought that omnivores, as they are allowed to eat both food and herbivores, had the worst movement (up, down left, right). Herbivores had a slighly better movement pattern being able to also move in the diagonal directions. Carnivores were given the most mobile movement of the animals, since they required eating moving animals, I gave them 2 tile movement steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had originally wanted to have the animals find the closest animal/food when they were hungry and then pathfind their way towards that target objects, from past experience with pathfinding algorithms, I was considering implementing the A* pathfinding algorithm but due to time constraints (creating documentation), I decided that it wasn't worth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The food was meant to be a basic simulation of how plants grow, each turn they would increase in hunger replenishement value (by 1) and when they got past a certain value, they had a chance to spread to a random tile around them. This meant that with the right parameter values, the animals could live continuosly together without making any animal go extinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I created these animals and their movement was through classes. I had a master class for animals which had the __init__ function creating all of the variables and functions which were commmon to all animals, then I created a sub class for each of the separate animals which had a movment function which also encompassed moving.\n",
    "I originally thought that I would use more functions for the subclasses but turned out that I only needed one."
