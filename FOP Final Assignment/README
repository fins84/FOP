## Synopsis

PaSciRo Simulation Assignment for Fundamentals of Programming COMP1005/5005




## Contents

README - readme file for PaSciRo assignment

Assignment.py - back end code for the creation and interaction of the objects

Assignment_Test_argv.py - Testing code to create and run PaSciRo simulation using Assingment.Py (uses external Parameters)

Assignment_Test_counter_arg.py - (passes in variables though command line) Testing code which does a parameter sweep on the amount of animals and outputs their timesteps to a file

Assignment_Test_movesave_arg.py - (passes in variables through command line) Testing code which saves the individual time steps to a file

PsuedoCode.txt - Brainstorm document used to plan Assignment code structure

pasciroExample.py - Example Code provided by unit co-ordinator

Simulation_Results: (file containing test code not using argv)

    Assignment_Test.py - Testing code to create and run simulation using Assignment.py (doesn't use external parameters)

    Assignment_Test_counter_arg.py - Testing code which does a parameter sweep on the amount of animals and outputs their timesteps to a file

    Assignment_Test_movesave_arg.py - Testing code which saves the individual time steps to a file

Simulation_Results: (File which contains simulation results and code that looks at it)

    processing_results.py - Code used to process the results from test code

    test.csv - results from experiment used in report
